Hi! Gabriel here with my first project uploaded to github!
It's a little first step, but one of many to come!

So, we got here my THE HANGMAN GAME done in Python. It's a little game that i used to train my OOP, Class creation and programming logic skills and i split the different functions in 3 files and then used them all in the main python file.

 - At the screen_config.py file we have all functions related to the screen setup and dinamic background that changes through out the gameplay

 - At the writer.py you'll find every function related to some of the dinamic text that's displayed during the gameplay

 - At the game_features.py file is where most of the magic came true, using combining its own functions with functions from the other files, here you have the core gameplay mechanics code
